# openFBX

Lightweight open source FBX importer. It's not a full-featured importer, but it suits all my needs. It can load geometry (with uvs, normals, tangents, colors), skeletons, animations, materials and textures. 

This is a Go port of [github.com/nem0/OpenFBX](https://github.com/nem0/OpenFBX).
