# ofbx 

`ofbx` is a library for parsing FBX files. FBX files contain geometry, animation, texture and material information for 3D models. 

This is a Go port of [github.com/nem0/OpenFBX](https://github.com/nem0/OpenFBX).

`ofbx` is currently at version 0.1 and has limited functionality. The internal API will change drastically as we refactor away from patterns used in `nem0/OpenFBX`, and this will likely involve
significant changes to the external API as well.
